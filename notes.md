## Outline

Using Bower (some commands)

Why this is good
- keep stuff in one place
- don't have to scour over the net to get stuff
- easy for co-workers to hope on
- don't commit other's code to your projects

Bower vs. the other guys
- no consumption model
- you can use: RequireJS, Grunt, or your own
