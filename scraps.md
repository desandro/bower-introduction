I could go on and explain more of what Bower is. That you can point to your own git endpoints, your set up your own internal shorthand, and how to register your packages. But that's what the docs are for. Go ahead, and go to bower.io and read up. It's all there. That is the _what_ of Bower. From here on out, I want to talk about the _why_ of Bower.

Yes, I work at Twitter. And yes, I have contributed to Bower. But the reason I stand here today is not just to proslytize an assignment. I am excited to talk about Bower, becuase it's honestly worked for me as a user. I needed it for my own projects. I needed it, and since adopting it 8 months ago, I've found success. I'd like to share that with you.
