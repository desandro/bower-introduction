**real emotional reason why I love working with Bower**

problem with imagesLoaded in Masonry & Isotope

once I started breaking up code, opened up a whole new way of thinking about projects

previously, each resource has to stand up on its own

now, it was okay to divide and sub-divide code

+ anything that is re-useable
+ anything that has a well-defined purpose

once sectioned, that component has its own repo, its own issue tracker, its own changelog

No longer have to keep the whole mental model in your head. Just consider one small component at a time. Isolate its purpose and execute on it.

empowers you as a problem-solver

**Gives you more control**

not that I enjoy having stuff organized. What I gained was focus that it gave me. 

When I am working with Isotope, or Masonry, I don't have to worry about all the other stuff that's going on in the stack. I only concern myself with what I need to accomplish in this layer.
