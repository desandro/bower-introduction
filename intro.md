# Introduction

We are here today because we make websites.

If you wouldn't mind, 

If you 

How does it start? Create a new directory. 


And then you start to add stuff. Scripts, libraries, templates,

+ Foundation
+ Bootstrap
+ normalize.css
+ fitvid.js
+ video.js
+ Modernizr
+ jQuery
+ d3
+ underscore / lo-dash
+ Backbone
+ Angular JS
+ Effeckt.css
+ HTML Boilerplate
+ Masonry
+ RequireJS
+ Font Awesome
+ Compass

jQuery plugins

+ jQuery UI
+ Easing
+ form
+ gallery
+ Lightbox
+ modal

Own scripts

+ default styles
+ helper JS

These resources are great because they have taken care of all the heavy lifting. They are reliable, well-documented, and have tremendous usage. We get to take advantage of all that.

Consider how do you get this stuff?

+ Download
+ Clone git repo
+ already saved locally

Where do you put it?

+ lib/
+ lib/vendor/
+ assets/js/vendor

How do you keep track of it?

+ Store all assets on server
+ If in git, commit it to repo
+ If in git, use submodules

This is a lot of stuff. Even if you are creating a simple one page site, you will probably use a couple of these resources.

Whenever you have a lot of stuff, you have a lot of hassle. If your desk is too messy, you won't have enough space to do your work. You will be slowed down in your creative process, trying to find where the heck you put that thing you just had in your hand.

This is the problem of package management. How do you deal with all these resources, all these packages?

The answer .... is Bower.
